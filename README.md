# LeetCode-Tools
This is a library-cum-helper module for all your leetcode needs!

This library provides functions and tools for you to build LeetCode specific objects like linked-lists, binary trees etc, so you can debug the program on your own IDEs.

Full documentation coming soon, as the library is constantly being updated with more functions.
